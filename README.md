# ABOUT
This app detects moving objects within a camera's frame and boxes such objects in a green rectangle while tracking their movements. Moreover, all movements along with their intervals (how long the object was moving for) get recorded. Finally, such data is then plotted onto a UI for users to monitor. When, hovering over movement areas in the graph the exact start and end times pop up. Currently I have this program connected to a Raspberry Pi and running at my house.
